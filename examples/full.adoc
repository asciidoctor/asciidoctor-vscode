AsciiDoc is a mature, lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.
{description}

[NOTE]
====
Several examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
AsciiDoc produces complementary output when generating DocBook.

Most features labeled "`Asciidoctor only`" can be made available to the native AsciiDoc processor by using https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/blob/master/compat/asciidoc.conf[this AsciiDoc configuration file] from the Asciidoctor project.
====

== Paragraphs

.Normal
----
Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.

.Line breaks
----
To preserve a line break, end the line in a space followed by a plus sign. +
This results in a visible line break (e.g., `<br>`) between the lines.

.Literal
----
A normal paragraph.

 A sequence of lines that begin with at least one space is a literal paragraph.
 Literal paragraphs are treated as preformatted text.
 The text is shown in a fixed-width font
 and endlines are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.

.Admonition
----
NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information.
Its purpose is determined by the label
at the beginning of the paragraph.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

TIP: Pro tip...

IMPORTANT: Don't forget...

WARNING: Watch out for...

== Document Header

IMPORTANT: A header is optional.
When you do add a header to your document, the only required element is a title.

CAUTION: The header may not contain blank lines and must be offset from the content by at least one blank line.

.Title only
----//toc::[]

= My Document's Title

My document provides...
----

.Title and author line
----
= My Document's Title
Doc Writer <doc.writer@asciidoctor.org>

My document provides...
----

.Title, author line and revision line
----
= My Document's Title
Doc Writer <doc.writer@asciidoctor.org>

----

IMPORTANT: You cannot have a revision line without an author line.

== Section Titles (Headers)

.Article doctype
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section

=== Level 2 Section

==== Level 3 Section

===== Level 4 Section

====== Level 5 Section

== Another Level 1 Section
----

[.result]
====
// float is required to create plain headers

[float]
== Section Level 1

[float]
=== Section Level 2

[float]
==== Section Level 3

[float]
===== Section Level 4

[float]
====== Section Level 5
====

WARNING: When using the article doctype (the default), you can only have one level-0 section title (i.e., the document title) and it must be in the document header.

NOTE: The number of equal signs matches the heading level in the HTML output.
For example, _Section Level 1_ becomes an `<h2>` heading.

.Book doctype
----
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Section Level 1

=== Section Level 2

==== Section Level 3

===== Section Level 4

====== Section Level 5

= Section Level 0
----

===== Section Level 4

[float]

////
IMPORTANT: There are two other ways to define a section title.
_Their omission is intentional_.
They both require more markup and are therefore unnecessary.
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext[setext] title syntax (underlined text) is especially wasteful, hard to remember, hard to maintain and error prone.
The reader never sees the extra markup, so why type it?
*Be frugal!*

.Section anchors and links (Asciidoctor only)

`sectanchors`::
When this document attribute is set, a section icon anchor appears in front of the section title.

`sectlinks`::
When this document attribute is set, the section titles become links.

NOTE: Section title anchors depend on the default Asciidoctor stylesheet to render properly.

== Include Files

.Document parts
----
= Reference Documentation
Lead Developer

This is documentation for project X.

\include::basics.adoc[]

\include::installation.adoc[]

\include::example.adoc[]
----

CAUTION: Asciidoctor does not insert blank lines between adjacent include statements to keep the content separated.
Be sure to add a blank line in the source document to avoid unexpected results, such as a section title being swallowed.

.Include content from a URI
----
:asciidoctor-source: https://raw.github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master

\include::{asciidoctor-source}/README.adoc[]
----

NOTE: Including content from a URI is potentially dangerous, so it's disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater.
Assuming the safe mode is less than SECURE, you must also set the `allow-uri-read` attribute to permit Asciidoctor to read content from a URI.

== Horizontal Rules and Page Breaks

.Horizontal rule

* Kevin Spacey
* Jeremy Piven
====

NOTE: Blank lines are required before and after a list.

TIP: You can force two lists apart with a line comment, as the previous example demonstrates.
The text in the comment, (`^`), is optional, but serves as a hint to other authors that this line serves as an "end of list" marker.
//toc::[]

.Unordered, max nesting

  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.

Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.

list continuation:: a plus sign (+) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ gem install asciidoctor

====

IMPORTANT: Images are resolved relative to the value of the {imagesdir-ref}[`imagesdir` document attribute], which defaults to an empty value.
The `imagesdir` attribute can be an absolute path, relative path or base URL.
If the image target is a URL or absolute path, the `imagesdir` prefix is _not_ added.

TIP: You should use the `imagesdir` attribute to avoid hard coding the shared path to your images in every image macro.

NOTE: When the `data-uri` attribute is set, all images in the document--including admonition icons--are embedded into the document as https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/data_URIs[data URIs].

TIP: Instead of declaring the `data-uri` attribute in the document, you can pass it as a command-line argument using `-a data-uri`.

[TIP]
.Admonition and callout icons
====
Asciidoctor can "draw" icons using {fontawesome-ref}[Font Awesome^] and CSS.

To use this feature, set the value of the `icons` document attribute to `font`.
Asciidoctor will then emit HTML markup that selects an appropriate font character from the Font Awesome font for each admonition block.

Icons can also be used {icon-inline}[inline] and {icon-attribute}[styled].

.Air quotes (Asciidoctor only)

As a tip of the hat to Dick, Asciidoctor recognizes text between "air quotes" as a quote block.
Air quotes are the best thing since fenced code blocks.

== Tables

.Table with a title, three columns, a header, and two rows of content
----
.Table Title
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3 <1>
<2>
|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===
----
<1> Unless the `cols` attribute is specified, the number of columns is equal to the number of vertical bars on the first non-blank line inside the block delimiters.
<2> When a blank line follows a single line of column titles, the column titles row will be styled as a header row by default.

[.result]
====
.Table Title
|===
|Name of Column 1 |Name of Column 2 |Name of Column 3

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1
|Cell in column 3, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|Cell in column 3, row 2
|===
====

.Table with two columns, a header, and two rows of content
----
[cols="2*", options="header"] <1>
|===
|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|===
----
<1> The `*` in the `cols` attribute is the repeat operator. It means repeat the column specification for the remainder of columns. In this case, it means to repeat the default formatting across 4 columns. When the header row is not defined on a single line, you must use the `cols` attribute to set the number of columns and `options` attributes to make the first row a header.

[.result]
====
[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1

.Attribute assignment precedence (highest to lowest)
- Attribute passed to the API or CLI that does not end in `@`
- Attribute defined in the document
- Attribute passed to the API or CLI that ends in `@`
- Intrinsic attribute value (default values)

TIP: To make an attribute value that is passed to the API or CLI have a lower precedence than an assignment in the document, add an `@` symbol to the end of the attribute value.
