An extension that provides live preview, syntax highlighting and snippets for the AsciiDoc format using Asciidoctor.

![demo](images/simple.gif)

## How to Install

Launch Visual Studio Code "Quick Open" (`Ctrl+P`), paste the following command, and press `Enter`:

`ext install asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode`

Alternatively, you can use the built-in extension browser to find the _AsciiDoc_ by _asciidoctor_ extension and install it.

This extension is also available as a pre-version (alpha) in [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) and can be installed using the same procedure.

## How to Use

The extension activates automatically when opening an AsciiDoc file (.adoc, .ad, .asc, .asciidoc).

### Preview

To show the preview you can use the same commands as the Markdown extension:

* Toggle Preview - `ctrl+shift+v` (Mac: `cmd+shift+v`)
* Open Preview to the Side - `ctrl+k v` (Mac: `cmd+k v`)

The preview refreshes automatically, but it can also be forced with the _AsciiDoc: Refresh Preview_ command.

The preview supports setting attributes through the `asciidoc.preview.attributes` option.

By default the preview style follows the VSCode theme (`workbench.colorTheme`). To use Asciidoctor's style set option `asciidoc.preview.useEditorStyle` to `false`. It is also possible to set your own preview stylesheet with the `asciidoc.preview.style` option.

(See more details under [User Settings](#user-settings))

### Export as PDF

The extension provides a quick command to export your AsciiDoc file as PDF.

* Open the command palette - `ctrl+shift+p` or `F1` (Mac: `cmd+shift+p`)
* Select _AsciiDoc: Export document as PDF_
* Choose the folder and filename for the generated PDF

By default a separate binary is downloaded and used to render the document in PDF format. To use Asciidoctor PDF set option `asciidoc.use_asciidoctorpdf` to `true`.<br/>
(See more details under [User Settings](#user-settings))

### Save as HTML

The extension provides a quick command to export your AsciiDoc file as HTML using the default Asciidoctor stylesheet.

* Open the command palette - `ctrl+shift+p` or `F1` (Mac: `cmd+shift+p`)
* Select _AsciiDoc: Save HTML document_
* The file is generated in the same folder as the source document

The shortcout key of `ctrl+alt+s` (Mac: `cmd+alt+s`) will also save the document.

### Save to Docbook

The extension provides a quick command to export your AsciiDoc file as DocBook.

* Open the command palette - `ctrl+shift+p` or `F1` (Mac: `cmd+shift+p`)
* Select _AsciiDoc: Save to DocBook_
* The file is generated in the same folder as the source document

Only DocBook 5 is supported.

### Snippets

Several code snippets are provided including but not limited to: include statements, images, links, header, headings, lists, blocks, etc...

For a full list open the command palette and select _Insert Snippet_.

### Identifying the VS Code Environment

The `env-vscode` attribute is set on all output documents. If you need to identify or handle the VS Code environment you can use an `ifdef` expression similar to the following:

```asciidoc
ifdef::env-vscode[]
This is for vscode only
endif::[]
```

### Diagram Integration

This extension supports a wide range of diagrams from BPMN to Graphviz to PlantUML and Vega graphs using [kroki](https://kroki.io/) and [asciidoctor-kroki](https://github.com/Mogztter/asciidoctor-kroki).

You can [see the full range](https://kroki.io/#support) on the kroki website.

Note that this extension will send graph information to https://kroki.io. If this is an issue it is also possible to use your own kroki instance (see [the instructions](https://github.com/Mogztter/asciidoctor-kroki#using-your-own-kroki) for further information).

To enable diagram support, set the `use_kroki` parameter in your User Settings to `true`.

To cache and save diagrams locally set the `kroki-fetch-diagram` attribute in your document header:

```asciidoc
= My Amazing Document
:kroki-fetch-diagram:
```

This will store images by default in your document folder, however you may also set `imagesdir` to store them elsewhere:

```asciidoc
= My Amazing Document
:kroki-fetch-diagram:
:imagesdir: media
```

### Use Asciidoctor.js extensions

When using the preview, the VS Code extension can load and register Asciidoctor.js extensions.

By convention, extensions must be located in `.asciidoctor/lib` (at the root of your workspace).
The VS Code extension will recursively load all files with the extension `.js` as Asciidoctor.js extensions.
For instance, the following files will be loaded: `.asciidoctor/lib/emoji.js`, `.asciidoctor/lib/emoji/index.js` and `.asciidoctor/lib/foo/bar/baz.js`.

To use an Asciidoctor.js extension, you should enable the feature by checking "Enable Asciidoctor.js extensions registration" in the extension settings.
The first time, you will also need to confirm that you trust the authors of the Asciidoctor.js extensions located in _.asciidoctor/lib_.

![Asciidoctor.js extensions trust confirmation message](images/asciidoctor-vscode-trust-exts.png)

**‚ùó Important:** This feature will execute JavaScript code and should not be enabled if you don't fully trust the authors of the Asciidoctor.js extensions.

**üí° Tip:** You can always update the trust mode using the command "Manage Asciidoctor.js Extensions Trust Mode".

You can create a new extension by creating a JavaScript file in the `.asciidoctor/lib` directory or use an existing one.  
Here's an example of how to use the [asciidoctor-emoji](https://github.com/mogztter/asciidoctor-emoji) extension:

1. Install the npm package in the workspace directory:

    ```shell
    npm i asciidoctor-emoji
    ```

2. Create a file a JavaScript file in _.asciidoctor/lib_ with the following content:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = require('asciidoctor-emoji')
    ```

3. Enjoy :tada:

## Issues

If you encounter any problems with the extension and cannot find the solution yourself, please open an issue in the dedicated GitHub page: [asciidoctor-vscode/issues](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode/issues).

Before opening an issue, please make sure that it is not a duplicate. Your problem may have already been brought up by another user and been solved: [asciidoctor-vscode/issues all](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=).

When you do open an issue, remember to include the following information:

1. Description of the issue
2. VSCode version, OS (_Help -> About_) and extension version
3. Steps to reproduce the issue<br/>
**IMPORTANT**: We cannot solve the issue if you do not explain how you encountered it
4. If the problem occurs only with a specific file, attach it, together with any screenshot that might better show what the issue is.

If your issue only appeared after updating to a new version of the extension, you can roll back to a previous one via the extensions browser. Click on the small gear icon beside the AsciiDoc extension, then select _Install Another Version..._. A selection menu will appear allowing you to select which version you want to install.

## Contributing

To contribute simply clone the repository and then commit your changes. When you do a pull request please clearly highlight what you changed in the pull comment.

Do not update the extension version or changelog, it will be done by the maintainers when a new version is released.

If you want to update the readme, you are free to fix typos, errors, and add or improve descriptions; but, if you have a style change in mind please use an issue (or specific pull request) so that it can be discussed.
