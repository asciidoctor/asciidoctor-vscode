== Hacking and Testing the Extension

Currently, testing the extension is only supported on Linux as the build scripts are not compatible with Windows.

. Clone the repository from Github
+
 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-vscode.git

. Open the folder within Visual Studio Code.

. Make changes (ideally on a separate branch).

Testing is done differently on the desktop client and the web client.

=== Desktop

. With the folder open in Visual Studio code, from the menu bar, select Run > 'Start Debugging' (or click the Run and Debug icon on the left sidebar and click on the green 'Run Extension' play button)
. A new Visual Studio Code instance will open with '[Extension Development Host]' in the header.
. You can use the first Visual Studio Code instance to:
* Apply breakpoints in the code (by clicking on a line number).
* Access the Debug Console.
* See errors in the Terminal window.

. You can find helpful debug information in:

* The extension logs -- Go to the Command Palette and select the option 'Developer: Open Extension Logs Folder'.
* The web view developer tools -- Go to the Command Palette and select the option 'Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools'.

=== Web

On Linux to test the extension run the following command within the repository folder from the command line:

 $ npm run build-web && npx @vscode/test-web --browserType=chromium --extensionDevelopmentPath=${PWD}

Looking at the browser's Web Developer tools can often help locate errors.

== Updating The Grammar

This package now uses the {uri-atom-textmate-language}[Atom language package] to generate a grammar.

This can be updated manually using the following process:

. Install the `cson` npm package
+
  npm install --global cson

. Retrieve and convert the grammar:
+
[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
curl {uri-atom-textmate-language-raw} | cson2json > ./syntaxes/Asciidoctor.json

. Now manually edit and change the scope name from:
+
[source,json]
"scopeName": "source.asciidoc",
+
to
+
[source,json]
"scopeName": "text.asciidoc",

Because this package has diverged slightly from upstream it may be best to cherry-pick commits after the original conversion or do before/after comparisons and account for each change.

Where possible it is recommended to do PRs upstream and then use that result here.
